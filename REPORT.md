# What Was Done:
- Installed the Arduino support package in Simulink to control an Arduino board.
- Set up the Arduino by identifying the correct COM port and verifying the connection.
- Created a Simulink model with blocks to make the LED on pin 9.
- Configured settings for the Arduino in Simulink.
- Connected the LED and a resistor to the Arduino.

# Conclusion:
This lab taught me how to connect Simulink and Arduino to controll an LED. 
It demonstrated how to properly install tools, set up the Arduino, and build a simple program to make the LED blink.
