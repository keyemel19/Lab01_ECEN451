# What Was Done:
- Installed the Arduino support package in Simulink to control an Arduino board.
- Set up the Arduino by identifying the correct COM port and verifying the connection.
- Created a Simulink model with blocks to make the LED on pin 13 blink.
- Configured settings for the Arduino in Simulink, like the hardware type and how often the code runs.
- Deployed the code to the Arduino in Normal Mode, where it runs independently from the computer.
  
# Conclusion:
This lab taught how to connect Simulink and Arduino to control hardware, like an LED. 
It showed how to properly install tools, set up the Arduino, and build a simple program to make the LED blink.
Running the code in Normal Mode demonstrated how the Arduino can execute tasks on its own without needing a constant connection to the computer.
